Typical example questions are:

* Design a newsfeed ranking algorithm
* Design local search ranking
* Design if an old post would be good for "On this Day" memories feature
* This is the key highlights of what is expected for the Machine Learning Design interview:

Expectations

* You should be able to describe the components of an end-to-end ML system, including but not
limited to; model development, evaluation, and deployment.
* You should be able to use existing toolsets to model the problem and break down its
components.
* Be ready to analyze your approach while understanding the tradeoffs between your design
decisions.
* We expect you to have a good understanding of common ML tools/techniques, but we do not
expect you to know and memorize every ML algorithm out there.

# Coding 
* leetcode 
* codility
* Elements of programming interviews in Python

# Applied ML
* Common ML concepts (including but not limited to) - bias/variance tradeoff, underfitting/overfitting, Linear/Logistic regression, cost functions, regularization, PCA, etc.
* Neural Networks - drawing the architecture and explain cost functions, backpropagation algorithm (Usually a smaller 2-3 layer network).
* Deep Learning - different layers, functionality and uses
